# Twilio Programmable Voice Client Front-end

This application was originally a fork of the Twilio quickstart repo [client-quickstart-node](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/client-quickstart-node).
I made significant changes such as converting the JQuery code to Vanilla JS, separating the Node.js back-end 

The Node.js back-end repo is located here [vanilla-twilio-node](https://github.com/nckdhl/vanilla-twilio-node).

I created this app to use personally in order to buy phone numbers in other countries and make/receive calls using local numbers.

### Some of the other functionality added:

1. Bootstrap
2. Login and authentication
3. Friendly UI
4. Input/Output device selection

This app is currently hosted at [vanillavoip.com](https://vanillavoip.com). 

Account creation upon invitation is not yet possible but will be as soon as I figure out how to integrate that securely with the Twilio Account and Application API.
